 The legislature of Missouri passed an act on February 16, 1847, that aimed to restrict the rights of Black individuals in the state. The law prohibited "Negroes and mulattoes" from learning to read and write and assembling freely for worship services. Additionally, the act forbade the migration of free Black people to the state. Those who violated any of the provisions of the law faced severe penalties such as a fine of up to $5,000 (equivalent to $160,000 today), a jail term of up to six months, or a combination of both. This law supplemented an earlier law from 1825, which imposed various restrictions on free Black people and defined a Black person as anyone with at least one Black grandparent. The 1825 law prohibited free Black people from keeping or carrying weapons without a special permit and settling in Missouri without a certificate of citizenship from Missouri or another state. The laws were enacted to maintain white supremacy in the condition, as in 1840, nearly 13% of Missouri's population was enslaved Black people, while free Black people made up less than 1% of the state's residents.
